## Usage Tips

### What to Personalize Every Time

1. **The customer's first name** (always)
2. **Specific details from the review** (problem mentioned, product, service)
3. **The corrective action** (if applicable)
4. **The signature** (your first name, position)

### What to Avoid

- Copy-pasting without any personalization
- Using the same template for all reviews
- Ignoring specific details mentioned by the customer
- Responses that are too long (150 words max generally)

### Adapting to Your Brand Tone

These templates are intentionally professional yet warm. Depending on your positioning:

- **More formal**: Replace "Hi" with "Dear", use strict formal language
- **More casual**: Add emojis (sparingly), more direct tone
- **More corporate**: Complete signature with position and company name
