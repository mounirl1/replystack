## Step 1: Audit Your Current Online Reputation

Before building a strategy, you need to know where you stand.

### 1.1 Map Your Online Presence

**Google search**:
- Search your company name
- Search "company name + reviews"

**Review platforms**:

| BBB | | | |
| [Industry-specific] | | | |

**Social media**:

### 1.2 Analyze Sentiment

For each platform, categorize your reviews:

| Very positive (5★) | | |
| Positive (4★) | | |
| Neutral (3★) | | |
| Negative (2★) | | |
| Very negative (1★) | | |

**Key questions**:
- What strengths are mentioned?
- What problems keep coming up?
- Are there unjustified or fake reviews?

### 1.3 Competitive Benchmark

Compare yourself to 3-5 direct competitors:

| Competitor | Google rating | # reviews | Response rate | Response tone |
|------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|

**What you're looking for**:

### 1.4 Identify Urgencies

Rank problems by priority:

| High urgency 🔴 | Medium urgency 🟡 | Low urgency 🟢 |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Recent very negative reviews without response | Average rating < 4 stars | Incomplete profiles |
| Fake reviews or defamation | Lack of recent reviews | Visual inconsistencies |

❌ "Get more reviews"
✅ "Obtain 20 new Google reviews per month for 12 months"

✅ "Respond to 100% of reviews within 48 hours within 3 months"

### 2.2 KPIs to Track

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 3: Optimize Your Online Profiles

### 3.1 Google Business Profile (Priority #1)

**Optimization checklist**:

- [ ] Exact business name (no added keywords)
- [ ] Correct primary category + secondary categories
- [ ] Verified, accurate address
- [ ] Active phone number
- [ ] Updated hours (including holidays)
- [ ] Website linked
- [ ] Complete description with natural keywords
- [ ] Quality photos (exterior, interior, team, products)
- [ ] High-resolution logo
- [ ] Services/products listed with descriptions
- [ ] Attributes filled in (accessibility, payment methods, etc.)
- [ ] Regular posts (news, offers, events)

**Impact**: A complete profile is **70% more likely** to attract visits.

### 3.2 Other Platforms

Apply the same rigor to:
- **Yelp**: Photos, description, response to reviews
- **Facebook**: Complete page, reviews enabled, message responses
- **LinkedIn**: Updated company page (for recruiting)
- **Trustpilot**: Verified profile if you're listed

### 3.3 Cross-Platform Consistency

Ensure these elements are **identical everywhere**:
- Business name (exact spelling)
- Address
- Phone number
- Logo
- Communication tone

**Why**: Inconsistencies hurt local SEO and create confusion.

## Step 4: Review Collection Strategy

### 4.1 Systematize Requests

Don't leave reviews to chance. Set up a system:

| Moment | Channel | Script |
|--------|---------|--------|
| End of service | Face-to-face | "Glad everything went well! A Google review would really help us out." |
| 24-48h after | SMS | "Thanks for your trust! Your Google review: [link]" |
| 3-5 days after | Email | Follow-up email with direct link |
| Ongoing | On-site | Visible QR code (counter, tables, window) |

### 4.2 Make It Easy

The simpler it is, the more reviews you'll get:

1. **Create a short link** to your Google review page
2. **Generate a QR code** to display everywhere
3. **Integrate the link** in automated emails
4. **Train your team** to ask at the right moment

### 4.3 Avoid Mistakes

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Buy fake reviews | Ask real customers |
| Offer incentive for positive review | Encourage without condition on rating |
| Ask friends/family | Target satisfied customers |
| Harass customers | Max 1 reminder |

---

## Step 5: Review Response Strategy

### 5.1 Why Respond to All Reviews

- **Positive reviews**: Reinforces loyalty, shows engagement
- **Negative reviews**: Defuses conflicts, reassures future customers
- **All reviews**: Improves local SEO (Google values active profiles)

### 5.2 Response Framework

**Positive review**:
```
1. Thank sincerely
2. Personalize (reference something from the review)
3. Invite them back
4. Sign

Example:
"Thank you so much for this feedback, [Name]! So glad
[element mentioned] worked for you. See you soon!
— The [Company] Team"
```

**Negative review**:
```
1. Thank for the feedback
2. Apologize sincerely (even if unjustified)
3. Briefly explain (without being defensive)
4. Offer a solution / direct contact
5. Sign with a name (humanize)

Example:
"Hi [Name], thank you for this feedback. I'm truly
sorry about [problem]. This doesn't meet our standards.
I'd invite you to contact me directly at [email/phone]
to discuss. — [Name], [Title]"
```

### 5.3 Response Times

| Review type | Ideal time | Maximum time |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Negative review | < 24h | 48h |
| Positive review | < 48h | 1 week |
| Crisis/viral | < 2h | 6h |

### 5.4 Automate with AI

## Step 6: Crisis Management

### 6.1 Identifying a Crisis

A reputation crisis is characterized by:
- Abnormal volume of negative mentions
- A viral or massively shared review
- Negative media coverage
- A negative hashtag gaining traction

### 6.2 Crisis Response Protocol

**The first 2 hours**:
1. Don't panic
2. Assess the scope (real or perceived?)
3. Document everything (screenshots)
4. Identify the source and legitimacy

**The first 24 hours**:
1. Respond publicly with empathy
2. NEVER delete or censor
3. Offer direct contact
4. Prepare a statement if necessary

**After the crisis**:
1. Analyze what happened
2. Implement corrective measures
3. Communicate about improvements
4. Monitor mentions for several weeks

### 6.3 What NEVER to Do

- ❌ Ignore hoping it'll pass
